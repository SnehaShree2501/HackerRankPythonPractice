Let's learn about list comprehensions! You are given three integers  and  representing the dimensions of a cuboid along with an integer .   
Print a list of all possible coordinates given by  on a 3D grid where the sum of  is not equal to . Here, 0<=i<=X; 0<=j<=Y; 0<=k<=Z. Please use list comprehensions rather than multiple loops, as a learning exercise. Input Format :-Four integers X,Y,Z and N each on four separate lines, respectively.
Constraints

Print the list in lexicographic increasing order.

Sample Input

1

1

2

Sample Output

[[0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1], [0, 1, 0], [1, 0, 0], [1, 1, 1]]

# repo part 5 -> arranging the words in a string in lexicographical order
# repo part 6 ->Find the Runner-Up Score
Problem Statement
Given the participants' score sheet for your University Sports Day, you are required to find the runner-up score. You are given scores. Store them in a list and find the score of the runner-up.

Note
This is in reference to Python 3
