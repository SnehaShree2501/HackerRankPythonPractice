Let's learn about list comprehensions! You are given three integers  and  representing the dimensions of a cuboid along with an integer .   
Print a list of all possible coordinates given by  on a 3D grid where the sum of  is not equal to . Here, 0<=i<=X; 0<=j<=Y; 0<=k<=Z. Please use list comprehensions rather than multiple loops, as a learning exercise. Input Format :-Four integers X,Y,Z and N each on four separate lines, respectively.
Constraints

Print the list in lexicographic increasing order.
